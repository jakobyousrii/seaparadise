# Seaparadise App

<p>I've made this portfolio page completely in React.js, where I've used custom hooks, Redux, basic Form validation, GET and POST requests to a
dummy database created in Firebase and it's completely responsive.</p>


<p>Sea Paradise App has logic where any user can order some food by inserting the wanted amount and by clicking on add to cart button.</p>

<h2>Cart: </h2>
<p>When the user has clicked on a cart, he can change or delete the amount for a specific product, and then the user can click on the button: "Order".</p>.

<h2>Form:</h2>
<p>Now, the user has to fill out the form, cause the restaurant needs to know where to send the order.  </p>

<h2>VALIDATING FORM:</h2>
<p>As you can see, if inputs don't have the required data, then the user will see an error, and the form button will be disabled until the form becomes valid.</p>

<h2>Finishing Order:</h2>
<p>When the form is valid, the user will get the notification that his order has been successful, and everything from the cart will be deleted, and ready for any new orders.</p>
